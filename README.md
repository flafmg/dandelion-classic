## TO DO :
- [X]  refactor this entire thing fuck i hate my life
- [X]  Classic protocol implementation
- [ ]  CPE implementation
- [ ]  Scrpiting system

# Bad code ahead!

the current implementation sucks, im going to rewrite all of this at some point, i made this project only to learn more about how minecraft work so it is messy, broken and weird, but i will do something better someday
